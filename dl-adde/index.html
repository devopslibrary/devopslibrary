        <h1>Automated Declarative Data Engine</h1>
        <h3>
          <br />
          Automate handoffs and communication between your teams via a shared
          API, regardless of development experience. Your team's won't need to
          learn how to build an API, all of that is taken care of via the DevOps Library ADDE
        </h3>
        <br />
        <h3>What is declarative data?</h3>
        <p>
          Declarative data is what we call output from one team (usually in the
          form of conversations within JIRA & Service Now tickets, excel sheets,
          and occasionally a very outdated CMDB) that's consumed by one or more
          other teams.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>
          Here are some typical examples:
        </h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Linux SRE: What DNS Servers should I use in X datacenter?</li>
          <li>NOC: What's the IPMI/iLO IP for X host?</li>
          <li>
            PM: What version of the application is deployed in X environment?
          </li>
          <li>Mgmt: When was X last patched?</li>
          <li>
            New Hire: What should I name my VM? Do we follow a naming standard?
          </li>
          <li>SRE: What application types do we have? Who owns them?</li>
          <li>DBA: Are you sure you really put my DB on VLAN 450?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>How does ADDE solve these questions?</h3>
        <p>
          ADDE can be summarized as an automatically generated API (GraphQL &
          REST endpoints, as well as PowerShell cmdlets) based on JSON data
          stored within a Github repository, with a bunch of helpers wrapped
          around it to simplify things. Let's explain it a bit by going through
          one of the the examples above, and what they'd look like by using ADDE.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>Linux SRE: What DNS Servers should I use in X datacenter?</h4>
        <p>
          Answer: Lets say there's an infrastructure team that manages DNS
          within each datacenter (as well as a lot of other config information).
          They come from a Microsoft background and are pretty familiar with
          PowerShell. Instead of responding via Slack every few weeks on what
          DNS server someone should be using, they could instead run a very well
          documented cmdlet.
          <!-- prettier-ignore -->
          <pre>
            $sfo01 = @{}
            $sfo01.Add("name", "sfo01")
            $sfo01.Add("dns_servers", @{"primary": "10.0.0.50", "secondary": "10.0.0.51"})
            $sfo01.Add("location", "San Francisco Colocation")
            Configure-AddeServer -Org OrgName -AuthToken $authToken
            Update-AddeObject -Name sfo01 -Type datacenters -Values $sfo01
          </pre>
          When ran, this tiny script will authenticate to the OrgName organization,
          create a folder named datacenter (if it doesn't already exist) within
          the LoremRepo repository, and generate a JSON schema file within the folder
          to ensure that all additional "datacenters" have the same keys and value 
          types.  Lastly, it will create a file named sfo01.json under the datacenters/
          file, and automatically commit and merge the change into the repository.

          Immediately, ADDE will then serve this information at:<br/><br/>
          <ul>
            <li>https://orgname.adde.to/rest/datacenters (for REST, with automatically generated Swagger Docs)</li>
            <li>https://orgname.adde.to/graphql (for GraphQL, browseable via Graphiql UI)</li>
            <li>https://orgname.adde.to/docs (For auto-generated documentation)</li>
            <li>https://orgname.adde.to/powershell (For auto-generated PowerShell cmdlets)</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          That means your Linux SRE can just curl the REST api to get a list of all datacenters, or hit a specific
          datacenter to get even more information about that one, including the DNS servers.  Each endpoint also
          has built-in CRUD functionality (Create, Remove, Update, Delete), so it's incredibly easy to keep the
          information up-to-date. 

          <br/>
          Let's fast forward a little bit and see what things look like:
          <br/>
          * The Linux team has started using Terraform to bring up VMs on VMware.  For the
          portgroup, they use the "http" datasource to automatically pull in the right one,
          as the VMware and application dev teams have both agreed to store that information under
          /apps with a jsonref reference a portgroup under /portgroups.
          <br/>
          * The VM itself is then configured via Chef, which then pulls in the DNS server information
          from the /datacenters endpoint, dynamically based on which datacenter the VM is in.

          <br/><br/>
          You might be thinking, why don't all the teams all just speak via Terraform, or via Chef, or use a shared
          MySQL database for this information, etc.

          <br/><br/>You aren't wrong, and in a perfect world you are able to all align on a single technology.  That is
          also very difficult in most cases.  Let's say you go with Terraform.  That's going to work great for all the
          teams that Terraform has a provider for.  Let's say the VMware team has autopatching configured, a perfect
          beyond most peoples wildest dreams set of ESXi clusters, all configured via a mountain of PowerCLI scripts called
          automatically via some web of scheduled tasks.

          <br/><br/>Would Terraform have made their life easier?  Pretty good chance.  They're currently working on setting up
          Kubernetes on AWS as the next platform for all the teams.  What do you think the odds are of them rewriting all 
          the scripts in Terraform?  Not very high in most cases.  Instead, they could simply add a one-liner or two at the end 
          of the Add-AllThePortGroups.ps1 script, writing all of the information you actually need, consumable in whatever
          way you'd like.

          You'll run into the same problem with the other options as well.  Use MySQL to store everything?  The Windows
          admins are going to be in for a fun experience.  Writing a beautiful GraphQL API in Golang?  We love graphql
          too, but that doesn't mean the teams you work with are going to have any idea how to consume it.  Our goal is
          to make it as easy as possible teams to speak the same language with each other, without mandating WHICH
          language that is.

          <br/><br/>
          <h2>
            What about vendor lock-in?
          </h2>
          <p>You wouldn't be good at your job if you didn't worry about vendor lock-in, especially for something that
            your teams use to interface with each other.  That's a big reason behind utilizing Github to store your data
            within YOUR git repositories.  All of the data is stored in the easiest possible format to consume, JSON.  In
            the event that you decide ADDE isn't meant for you, you could just dump all of it into a key value store, a
            database of your choosing, or just have the teams clone the repository and reference it manually.
          </p><br/>
          <h2>What are the advantages of using Git as the datastore?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>No vendor lock-in (Can easily take your JSON and leave)</li>
            <li>Audit Log (Git diff)</li>
            <li>Backups (Git history)</li>
            <li>OS Neutral (Incredibly easy to modify on any OS, Git is widely accepted standard)</li>
            <li>Simplified Permissions (purely based on Git permissions)</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <h2>Disadvantages of using Git as the datastore?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Performance & Size Limits - You are limited to 500,000 files per
              repository, with a maximum size of 1GB total (meaning 500k total 
              objects within a single API).  ADDE is intended for declarative
              data, not as a high performance database.  The read performance is
              augmented by caching, so queries via REST/Graphql/etc. are all
              incredibly fast (all the JSON within the repository is ready to go
              in memory).  With that said, ADDE has a default maximum limit of
              10,000 requests per hour per API (over 2.77 per second).
            </li>
            <li>
              Validation of Data - A large advantage to using a SQL database is
              that all schema is declared in advance, ensuring any new data
              adheres to that schema.  A github repository has no concept of
              schema, as you can store just about anything in it.  ADDE solves
              this issue by automatically generated a JSON Schema file anytime a
              new object type is added.  It will then automatically enforce that
              schema on all new updates, preventing bad data from being added to
              the repository.  Need to modify the schema?  You can easily
              directly update the .schema.json file and create a PR on the 
              repository, or edit the schema within the ADDE management interface.
